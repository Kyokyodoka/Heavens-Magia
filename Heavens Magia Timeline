Basic Timeline of Heaven’s Magia:

Assuming the order of events from Rebellion onward;

20XX, prior to Homura’s reset: Rebellion, or more known as Madoka Movie 3, happens...Homura resets the timeline into the ‘third world’ half assly mixing the universes to result in her desired world. Ultima-Godoka isn’t pleased with her being ripped ‘in half’ and is left in heaven. The Incubators are also made into the slave race to Homura, and exist solely to serve her and Magical Girls, even having to tell magical girls beforehand all the consequences of being a Puella Magi. This results in Magical Girls being far more common in other timelines and MUCH more organized and united by 2050 in the final timeline.

20XX, a year later: Homura, for varying reasons, realizes that Madoka is slowly learning that she is infact a goddess and breaks down before admitting all her problems and her guilt is paramount and obvious. She cries, embracing Madoka, and Madoka finally reconnects into her other self and thinks up a solution to the problem. Madoka realizes that she herself is also to blame for the situation, and that with her overwhelming Kharmic destiny she would be able to save Homura from her situation and ‘fix’ the situation but there would be irreparable consequences that she would have to bear the brunt of. Homura, always selfish, takes an oath to Madoka and promises to ‘be a good wife and lover to her’. This resets the world for a final time, sending the story into the world Heaven’s Magia itself takes place in.

1.5 Billion years ago: Homura’s ‘skin of evil’ is transplanted onto the burning crust of the planet, all evil is born in this primordial soup as evolution and Kayblis’ original form with it, Kayblis spawns his others in the beast tribe...but is quickly cursed by his new family who make him both immortal and unable to take title of “Lucifer”. Coincidentally, that demon was Amon...The devilman sion and the great betrayer of demonkind.

65 Million years ago: For the better part of 1.4 billion years, the Lucifer of the era (Kkulf Kkulf) has slowly grown an army of the ancient demons, among them the beast tribe and flame tribes. Madoka and Homura first realize this strange disturbance of the universe, and Homura leads the Puella Magica saints to war in the Cretacious before causing a mass extinction of demonkind by rocketing an asteroid into the earth with her magic. Lucifer and demonkind are sent to ‘hell’ an ice sheet in the deep dark polar regions. This ‘War of a year’ was mostly won down to the fact that Amon, in a deal with heaven...decided to plead there to be a way for demons to ascend to heaven and not be damned. Homura granted him the title of ‘first Devilman’ and promised he would be a hero in the coming conflicts.

2001: The events of Vento Aureo happen, specifically the fact that Giorno Giovanna acquires Golden Experience Requiem. This makes him, accidently, immortal. Yet, with Passone, he becomes one of (if not the) most powerful man in Italy.

2026: Great Britain disintegrates after a referendum on Scotish Independence, paramilitaries become the norm amongst the region...and generally Britain begins a dark age early then the average.

2029: L. A. I. N (Logistical Artificial Intelligence Network) begins her existence in France. She quickly begins to dream of France, Magical girls, and Nepleon. All of which will come to help her in the years that follow.

2030: Lucifer "Satan" is born as a child Professor Asuka, who himself succumbs to his own research into demonkind, and murders his wife who turned out to be a time traveling Magical Girl from the future. “Ryo Asuka”, grows up mentally unstable and rich, and utterly determined to figure out his father’s research. In the same year, Tank Schools (known as Shensha-Do) became all the rage, and became a standard sport for children and teenagers even after the apocalypse in the coming ten odd years.

2031: The events of the ascension of Madoka happen, this results in a massive burst of wind traveling around japan and the eastern world causing minor to major damages and causing Hanakawa Tsubasa’s skirt to be sent skyward causing a teenage Araragi-san to get the hots for her. Setting in motion not just ‘The Mitakihara Sainthoods’, but also the saga of the Great Oddity master Araragi Koyomi. More importantly though, it breaks open the demonkind ice shelf and releases the spirits of the demons inside.

2033: The Foundation of the ‘Magius Order’ is created, they begin to push for increasingly radical unitarization of the Magical girl world and later build an almost 80 billion dollar fund in case of a coming war.

2035: Sayaka Miki and Kyoko teach one another how to Doppel, Mami nearly witches out when she attempts it, and is affraid that the power of the Doppels will be abused. The three of them promises to make Doppeling something that can be trained and the three of them help master the art with time (though Mami refuses to doppel due to her previously bad experience).

2040: Lucifer breaks out Zennon and Kayblis from their underground prison, while a very bored military manger called Guts Ioni begins dating Casca Gulpha. The two of them hear about the "The Grand Sabath Concert" and decide to book a ticket...coincidently, there was only two left too...

2041 New Years Day: On New Years Day, 2041, "The Grand Sabath Concert" starts. Drinking, boozing, and whoring are boundless as the music club is quite litterally full to the bursting with people. Besides the previously mentioned Casca and Guts, who get trashed with their old friend who interduced them Griffith...the eye of note however is that of "Ryo Asuka" drinking like a spoiled brat with young lovers Akira Fudo and the 'escentric' for lack of a better term Miki Makimura. As the beat gets deep, and Ryo begins shanking people with broken Beer bottles, the violence escalates as demons and devilmen rupture out the ritual that Ryo had set beforehand. Guts and Akira become devilman, and Miki Makimura is forced to watch in horror as people are projected across the building. Oriko's vision of this, and the later filming of the event that landed on the dark web reach the 'ever knowing' Magius Order who with funding prepares for the coming conflict by calling a "Magia Declaration"

2041 January 2nd: The Magia Declaration is broadcasted through the Magia lines, it is viewed my the nearly million told Puella Magi alive at the point in time and is consiquently a beginning of a long debate on the Magical Girl's role in the coming conflict, it last for several weeks fallowing

2041 January 17th: After deliberation of the myraiad Puella Magi able to attend the event, it was decided the the Puella Magi will attempt to save humankind by a surprisingly close vote. Out of the 405 women in attendence, Only 205 voted for the vote...with the deciding ones being the Puella Magi of Mitakihara itself.

2041 Febuary: Akira Fudo returns to his last year of highschool as he prepares for his 400 meter nationals, while Guts is finally calmed down after going utterly bezerk after his rampage at the Sabath in no small part to Casca and Griffith managing to calm him down. The three swear to figure out what was going on, and more then that hunt down the crazy white haired weirdo who caused all of this. Miki Makimura on the otherhand, gets contacted by an incubator who tells her she as 'a very odd potential I can't quite understand', her wish is to 'protect Akira Fudo and his family'.

2041 April 9: Akira Fudo duels Guts, and after realizing he isn't a demon but a Devilman like him they form a deep brotherhood. The birth of the Espania's are widely celibrated on this date. Miki Makimura at the same day by chance meets a blue haired girl called Sayaka Miki they weirdly hit it off on account that they both LOVE mech shows despite both coming to realization that they are NONSENSE because tanks are better, this will start a close but complex relationship of two mothers, and more then that interduce Miki Makimura to the greater world of the Puella Magi.

2042 Junary: Jinmin Obui, during a normal and average night route suddenly stops the traincar in the middle of the subway and proceeds to violently rape, murder, and eat every man woman and especially child on the train...Akira Fudo is far too late to save anyone, as Jinmen slinks into the cold night. Lucifer finds him disgusting, but recruits him on the spot...Ryo for his part needs a bodygaurd now that Akira Fudo is playing superman across the planet with his 'recently annouced' girlfriend Miki.

2042 Febuary: Faim and Modoc, with tacit approval by Lucifer who thought they would be unsuccessful, organize an attempt to coup the US navy and prepare a minor nuclear war. Modoc successfully integrates into the admiralty while Faim works her way through the generalship...preparing a movement of nuclear missiles to be used for the occassion.
