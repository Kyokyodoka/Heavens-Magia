kazuma:0 "Sayaka sighed. Its been 100 years since she ruled over this land. These Texans. They still did not accept her yet. These Texans were always a rebellious bunch even when the U.S was still a thing. She had been taking up horseback riding lessons in order to try to appeal to them, though that was equally as mixed. Currently she was alone on the Texan plains. Her horse getting skittish and having run a bit away. She sighed and was going to go back when she saw something strange. A lone man was there, approaching her on horse back. He appeared to be no more than 16 at the most. She was about to ask his name but his expression was blank. "Steal" was the only thing he said and suddenly Sayaka found it draftier. With a pure white cloth in his hand and a blushing Sayaka he simply left. Saying no more leaving a very flustered Sayaka thankful that no one was around."

kazuma:0 ""Kazuma you're ba- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING?"\n\nMegumi had come back to greet her fearless leader only to be stopped in her tracks once she saw what he was wearing. On his head was a pure white cloth that you'd think would be somewhere more... delicate. A topic of much debate later that night as everyone even the Jin Roh, the most radical of Kazuma's band of misfits and randos, had to agree the boy had balls. From that moment on it was without a shadow of a doubt. That without dispute he was the bandit king."

#Jin Roh are polyamours MRAs, share the cunny. Madoka gave them a penis as a way of being protectors.
