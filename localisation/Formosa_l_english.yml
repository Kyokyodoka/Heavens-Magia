"Borgar"
"Chloe Lambert angrily stood in line at the Zimbabwean McDonalds. It was SUPPOSED to be a quick pit stop. Getting a simple borgar. Truly she underestimated these incompetence of these Africans and hated spending more time then she had too in this disgusting nation. The man in front of her was not making it easier either. The man looked like a shriveled up scrote with how ancient he was, carting around a wheelbarrow of what she estimated to be about 16 quintillion Zimbabwean bucks (inflation was hard on them).\n\n"Excuse me sir but coul-"\n\nShe began in a heavy French accent to the man who had been standing in front of her for about 30 mins. The negroid man only turned back to her and sneared showing his rotting teeth.\n\n"Silence wyte devul!"\n\nHe spoke in a guttural tone before turning back around and holding up the line. That did it. She was not going to let this ubermensch talk to her like this. In anger and without thinking she kicked the wheelbarrow. It let out a heavy groan as its foundation was disturbed, falling to its side and its contents falling out, spilling on the man in front of her. He tried to scream but was drowned out by the 16 quintillion Zimbabwean bucks falling on him. In an instant he was crushed. Aids quickly rushing trying to dig him out of his grave of money. Chloe for her part had to process what she had just done and then figuring that she should make herself scarce. Silently and slowly walking backwards out of the Zimbabwean McDonalds."
