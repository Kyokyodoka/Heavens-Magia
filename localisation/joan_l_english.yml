joan:0 "A girl looks defiantly ahead of her. The beings known for their eternal vile evil: anglos. They had her captured. She was to be burned at the stake. The price she pays for valiantly defending her homeland of France. As the flames are let on her pyre and thy lick at her feet and legs she sternly looks ahead to face her death with dignity but it did not come. Instead she called saw a village before her. An angel of sorts. "You have much to do" is all she said before she imparted some knowledge to her. The time and when she would be at. And she had much to do."

joan:0 ""Phenian! Report! What is this... Jin Roh." The slavic man himself was confused. This was not the usual three hour conversations on the glories of Manchuria he was used to but he was willing to humor this silly girl even if it meant cutting into precious Manchu time. 5 hours later. "And so that's pretty much everything. Now back to Manchuria- Joan? Joan? You ok?" Phenian had just finished his 5 hour long lore discussion on the Jin Roh to Joan who had paled in the first couple seconds when explaining the whole thing about penis worship. From there it only got worse."
"Later that night she doubled the inquisition guard."

joan:0 ""Now to start us off about the very first thing you need to know in the 22nd century: Manchuria!" Joan was still confused at this man. Basically a wiseman her army had plucked out randomly that not even they could say where he came from. He for his part did not seem to mind as well. Taking his new job in stride. Likewise Joan was unsure why she herself was just accepting this but she was out of her element and no one really wanted to be the one to bring her up to speed. Three hours later Joan was still very much confused about how the modern world worked and what was going on but she did however now know a lot about a far eastern region of a place called Manchuria and its very proud language. Mostly since Phenian tied her down when she tried to leave after 15 minuets."
"And this concludes today's lesson on the first year of Manchu history"
